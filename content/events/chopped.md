Helllllooo and welcome to our first FAM COMPETITION!!!
We will be hosting a CHOPPED x TASA, where each family is tasked to build a Gordon Ramsay approved dish out of ingredients provided courtesy of Autumn's lidl grocery shopping capabilities. Your dish will be graded on presentation, litty-ness, effort, back story and taste. So get creative! See you MONDAY fellow chefs ❤️
Logistics and details will come soon. Come thru for loads of cooking fun and bonding 7:00 pm @ Tawes 0310

Also don't worry if you don't have a family or some of your fam members can't come! We'll be hosting temporary adoptions and you will def have people to team up with!!
