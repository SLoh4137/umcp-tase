It’s time.... to du-du-du-du-du- play Volleyball!! For our next GBM we will be having a 7 v 7 volleyball competition! HAH GOTEEEM! We will be having it at Eppley Recreation Center on the volleyball court side (duh) from 8-10PM. It’ll honestly be a great time to learn, have fun, compete and bond with everyone in TASA! Bring your friends, children, family, pet squirtle, everyone is invited (who has a UMD ID since they’d need to get into eppley).\
\
People will be divided up into teams of 7 and play to 15 points in which then we would rotate the losing team off the court.\
\
YOU DON’T HAVE TO BE GOOD TO COME, I REPEAT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BE GOOD TO COME haha.\
