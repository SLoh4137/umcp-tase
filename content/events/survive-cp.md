Hear ye, hear ye…\
\
The zombie kingdoms of TASA and FCA have decided to ally together and create a new, unified TASA x FCA empire!\
\
They want to expand and have decided on UMD as their next targeted conquest.\
\
Their mission? Turn all the students into zombies. To do this, they will be sending out 10 of their best zombie taggers from the TASA x FCA empire to turn everyone undead.\
\
Your mission? Travel throughout campus, complete tasks, and avoid being turned into a zombie at all costs!\
