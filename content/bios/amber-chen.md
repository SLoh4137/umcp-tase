Hi! My name is Amber! I’m a Senior Biology major and hope to become a PA. I love dogs and food. I have a morkie named Alvin and my favorite food is noodles. I love to sleep and I procrastinate too much. I love one direction and BTS!!!! I always take pictures of my food before I eat and I’m really basic.
