Hi! I’m Grace and I’m your co-historian this year! I'm a junior majoring in Cell Biology and Genetics. Yes, I have a RBF but I promise I’m a very nice person. Feel free to come up to me, I won’t bite! Besides TASA :heart:, I like going to museums and concerts, hanging out with friends, and sipping tea. I’m here to capture all the amazing memories you’ll be making with TASA, so smile when I come over with my camera!
