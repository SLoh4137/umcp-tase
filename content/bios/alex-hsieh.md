Hi! I'm is Rebecca and I’m a pre-med sophomore Neurobiology and Physiology and Psychology double major! If I were on campus (which I won't be :'(), I’d probably either be a) in the diner eating pasta, b) at eppley for a barre class, or c) seeing my friends because I haven’t had social interaction in 5 months. So excited to meet you all :) !
