Hello! My name is Aza, and I’m excited to spend my third year on UMCP TASA’s board. In my remaining time here, I’d like to strengthen the Taiwanese American and Asian American communities on campus. My passions include eating obscene amounts of food, working with children, listening to/playing music, dogs, women’s rights, and traveling (in no particular order).
