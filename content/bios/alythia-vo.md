Hello everyone! My name is Alythia and I am a Junior Neurobiology & Physiology and Spanish double major on the pre-med track! I am very excited for another year on TASA's board and I can't wait to continue growing and strengthening our community even throughout the pandemic. If I have free time, I usually nap but my few other hobbies include bullet journaling, playing piano, watching kdramas and occasionally working out. I love meeting new people so please feel free to message me! Go TASA!!
