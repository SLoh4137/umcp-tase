Hi! My name is Alythia and I am a sophomore Neurobiology and Physiology and Spanish double major on the pre-med track! Iâ€™m not actually Taiwanese but I love TASA and am so excited to meet new people! My hobbies include bullet journaling, traveling, not going to the gym, eating a lot and being a bum! I love friends so please talk to me.
