Hi! I'm a sophomore double majoring in Neurobiology and Physiology and Psychology. Like an old lady, I spend my quarantine free time baking, knitting, and petting my cat, but I swear I'm fun (and not 90 years old) when I'm on campus. I love TASA and I'm always looking to make some new friends so feel free to reach out!
