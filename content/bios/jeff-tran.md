What's good fam my name is Jeff and I am a Computer Science & Economics major while simultaneously pursuing a Masters of Finance😤. In my free time I quarantine by myself (is what I tell the Feds)👀. For all of you studious souls, connect w/ me on LinkedIn🙌. For the other Unholy individuals💦, you can find me wherever you get your booze🍾. I love TASA because everyone is extremely supportive, so definitely do not hesitate to reach out to any of us. 👍🥡🥢🥟🍚🥂
