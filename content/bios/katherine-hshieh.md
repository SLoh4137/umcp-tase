Hey y'all!! I'm Katherine and I'm a sophomore majoring in general biology. I love skiing, coffee, and binge watching Netflix. I also have a slightly problematic shopping addiction that got worse over quarantine. Reach out if you have any questions about ITASA or TASA and I can't wait to meet everyone!!
