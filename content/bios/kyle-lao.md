Hi, I’m Aza….jk it’s actually Kyle #iykyk. I joined TASA my freshman year and it has honestly been one of the best parts of college for me. TASA brought me the best Big, introduced me to bubble tea, and gave me the change to meet a ton of amazing, loving, and fun people. Besides TASA, I love baking, playing volleyball, scrapbooking, traveling, and C-Stone. Come through so you can meet the real Aza—can’t wait to meet all of you!!
