I'm Matthew, I'm a sophomore double majoring in Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science. I've been trying to learn to play League during quarantine but I still suck :( so play with me if you ever want a confidence boost. I'll be friends with anyone who thinks white cheddar cheezits are better than extra toasty, because they are and Callie is wrong.
