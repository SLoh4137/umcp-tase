Hellooo, I'm Eva!!! I am one of our many senior advisors this year. I am super recognizable, you can probably find me anywhere there's peppa pig heh (There's one on my packback) I love ramen, any kind of noodles, and I love karaokes ~ It's gonna be my last year so come out to hang out with me and all of the AMAZING peeps in TASA :)
