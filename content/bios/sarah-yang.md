Howdy yalls!! I'm Sarah and I'm a junior philosophy major on the pre-med track. Outside of TASA, I'm also a campus tour guide! Some of my hobbies include curating Spotify playlists, doing my 10 step skincare routine, and eating ice cream. I'm super friendly and love making new friends so I can't wait to meet y'all and make you guys part of our TASA fam :^))
