Howdy!! I'm Sarah, a sophomore philosophy major on the pre-med track. Catch me around campus giving tours, at the diner eating soft serve, or in class trying not to fall asleep. I like curating Spotify playlists, skincare, memes, food, and hanging with friends + family. I'm super friendly so don't be shy and say hi!! Can't wait to welcome yalls into our TASA fam :^)
