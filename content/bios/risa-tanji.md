Henlo!! I'm your Culture Chair for this year, striving to learn about the Taiwanese culture while I fulfill my duties (I'm Japanese heh)! I'm open to new ideas and would love to have conversations with everyone, so please don't be afraid to talk to me or shoot me a message with an idea you'd like to see in TASA. I'm only 4'9" and not intimidating at all :^) Allow me to get to know you all :3
