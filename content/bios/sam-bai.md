Hey everyone! I'm Sam, and I'm a sophomore majoring in Computer Science (and maybe Statistics, but we'll see lol). Outside of TASA, I'm a part of TerpWushu, so if you ever want to try out Chinese martial arts, just hit me up and come check us out! In my spare time, I like to run, draw, read Webtoons, and play Pokemon Go (add me!). If you ever need someone to talk to about school or just life in general, I gotchu :). Looking forward to meeting everyone!
